    The \textbf{Minimum Vertex Cover} \textbf{(MVC)} is an extensively studied problem with numerous applications in operation research. MVC is a well-known NP-Complete problem. 
    
    The problem seeks the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in it, and hence forming the MVC solution.

Consider a graph $G = (V,E, c)$ where $V$ and $E$ denotes the set of vertices and edges of $G$ respectively, and $c$ is the set of vertex weight. We consider the Integer Program as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll@{}ll}
\text{minimize}  & \displaystyle\sum\limits_{v\in V} c_{v}&x_{v} &\\
\text{subject to}& \displaystyle   &x_{u} + x_v \geq 1,  &\forall \{u,v\}\in E\\
                 &                                                &x_{v} \in \{0,1\}.&
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Consider the LP-relaxation, we will have $x_v \in [0,1]$. We also define $V_0, V_1, V_{1/2}$ is the set of nodes whose fractional values are $0,1,1/2$ respectively. Then we have the following theorem:

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{mytheorem}[Nemhauser–Trotter]
        There exists an optimal solution \textit{OPT} with the following properties:
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item \textit{OPT} is a subset of $(V_1 \cup V_{1/2})$,
            \item \textit{OPT} includes all of $V_1$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{mytheorem}

    The Nemhauser–Trotter theorem guarantees that optimal LP extreme points satisfy $x_v \in \{ 0,1,1/2 \}$.

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    In this project, we try to make use of the Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm to solve the MVC, using \textbf{'pulp'} library to implement the algorithm, and then we use \textbf{'networkx'} library to check the result with the maximum-matching, since we already have:
\begin{align*}
    \textrm{maximum\_matching}(G) \leq \textrm{minimum\_VC}(G).
\end{align*} 

Moreover, we also try to improve the result with the strong BnB algorithm.
